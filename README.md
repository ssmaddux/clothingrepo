# Clothing Mock E-Commerce Full Stack Application

## Overview

This project is a simple mock E-Commerce Full Stack Application for a clothing store. It includes a frontend with DOM Manipulation, a MongoDB database, and a Mongoose/Express backend. The project is designed to provide an engaging user experience, allowing users to interact with various pages, make meaningful requests, and manage clothing items.

## Project Structure

The project is divided into two main components: the frontend and the backend, and it aims to achieve the following goals:

### Frontend

The frontend of the application is responsible for rendering the user interface and interacting with the user. Key features and components include:

<!-- - **Search Functionality**: Users can search for clothing items by providing a keyword. -->
<!-- - **Displaying Clothing Items**: The application displays clothing items based on user searches. -->
<!-- - **Create New Item**: Users can create new clothing items using a form. -->
<!-- - **Update and Delete Items**: Users can update and delete existing clothing items. -->
<!-- - **Reasonable Styling**: The frontend is styled to provide a visually appealing and user-friendly interface. -->

### Backend

The backend of the application handles data storage, retrieval, and the execution of CRUD operations. Key features and components include:

- **MongoDB Database**: Data is stored in a MongoDB database.
- **Express and Mongoose**: The backend is built using the Express.js framework and uses Mongoose for interacting with the database.
- **Models**: At least two models are defined, each with both Index and Show endpoints.
- **Axios for Data Retrieval**: Axios is used on the frontend to fetch data from the backend.
- **CRUD Routes**: At least four CRUD routes are implemented for one of the models on the backend.
- **Additional CUD Functionality**: At least one additional CUD (Create, Update, Delete) functionality is implemented on the frontend.
- **Git Commits**: Each group member is expected to make a minimum of five Git commits, contributing to the project's development.
- **Connected Backend**: The frontend and backend are connected, allowing data to flow between them effectively.

## Project Workflow

### Frontend Development

- **Creating Forms**: Develop forms for creating, updating, and deleting clothing items.
- **DOM Manipulation**: Implement DOM manipulation to dynamically render clothing items and interact with users.
- **Styling**: Style the frontend for a visually appealing user interface.
- **Testing and Debugging**: Test and debug the frontend to ensure proper functionality.

### Backend Development

- **Defining Models**: Define models for clothing items and any other relevant data.
- **Implementing CRUD**: Create routes and controllers for CRUD operations.
- **Setting Up MongoDB**: Configure and connect the MongoDB database.
- **API Endpoints**: Define API endpoints for data retrieval and manipulation.

### Integration

- **Connect Frontend and Backend**: Ensure the frontend can make requests to the backend and receive data.
- **Testing**: Test the integrated system to ensure data flows seamlessly.
